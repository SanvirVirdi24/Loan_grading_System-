Loan Grading System 
## ğŸš€ Excited to Share My Loan Grading and Insights Project! ğŸš€
I recently built a system that automates loan assessment using Python and pandas.
## ğŸ’¡ Key Features:
Grades customers (A-D) based on income & credit history.
Assigns banks like ABC Bank, XYZ Bank, etc., based on eligibility.
Generates insights: income-to-loan ratios, area-based loan stats, and more!
ğŸŒŸ This project helps financial institutions make smarter, faster decisions.

Would love your feedback!
